Intro:

With the tourism industry coming to a halt due to the coronavirus crisis, there will be no quick return to
its normal state. Shared economy -> airbnb -> extra income for many families and a beloved option for tourists
looking for a local experience/good prices -> suffered the most.

Looking forward, quality will be an important sell point of the hosts. And tourists will be even more budget-
conscious.

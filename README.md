## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The [mplleaflet](https://anaconda.org/IOOS/mplleaflet) package should be installed. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the 2016/2017 [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) Airbnb Data to better understand:

* Are superhosts able to charge more than regular hosts?
* Are superhosts better reviewed?
* Where are the most expensive properties located? Does that reflect the current real state prices of the neighbourhood?
* How does price fluctuate through the year?
* How do room characteristics affect the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The Jupyter Notebook called "Airbnb_Analysis" includes the complete analysis of the data, including exploratory aspects. I have followed the CRISP-DM Framework.

Custom Python Functions are in the "Custom_Functions.py" file. They are required to run the aforementioned notebook. 

Moreover, you will find the required datasets (*.csv) in this repository, as well as the HTML-Maps generated by the code.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found on my Medium post available [here](https://medium.com/@t.theoto/how-to-be-a-successful-airbnb-host-insights-from-seattles-and-boston-s-listings-d980f86e3dda).

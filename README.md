## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The [mplleaflet](https://anaconda.org/IOOS/mplleaflet) package should be installed. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the 2016/2017 [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) Airbnb Data to better understand:

* Are superhosts able to charge more than regular hosts?
* Are superhosts better reviewed?
* Where are the most expensive properties located? Does that reflect the current real state prices of the neighbourhood?
* Are most expensive listings actually better reviewed?
* How does price fluctuate through the year?
* How do ammenities affect the price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](tbd).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).
